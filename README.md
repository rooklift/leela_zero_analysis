SGF --> Leela Zero analysis (simple)

Analysis script for SGF files using [Leela Zero](http://zero.sjeng.org/).

* Requires [gofish](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/gofish) library (which I've included in this repo).
* Requires Leela Zero 0.17.
* The `config.json` file will need to be altered for anyone else's machine.
